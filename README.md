## Introduction
The Car Price Prediction System leverages machine learning to help users estimate the selling price of their cars. By considering key factors, the system aims to provide accurate price predictions, making it easier for sellers to price their cars competitively in the market.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the dataset for model training.
- **Model Training:** Uses a linear regression model to predict car prices.
- **Model Persistence:** Saves the trained model for future predictions using `pickle`.
- **Interactive Interface:** Users can input car attributes to get an estimated price.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains various car attributes such as:
- Mileage
- Production Year
- Number of Owners
- Engine Type
- Car Price (target variable)
